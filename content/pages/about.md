Title: About

This blog is meant to be my space to shout into the void of the web.
Expect to see posts about my hobbies, projects or whatever I happen to find interesting at the time.


Me? I'm just a humble software engineer with some scatterred interests. I've been writing code since I was a wee lad, ripping through Instructables articles on building Arduino projects.
These days I write mostly Python and C#. The former because of it's incredible flexibility, making it fast to churn things out, and the latter because of it's incredible rigidity, making it scale well to large projects.

Beyond software I engage with a few hobbies, namely snowboarding which I took up a couple years ago and piano which I took lessons for as a kid and have been playing off and on for the last few years. I also play video games (shoutout to my love/hate relationship with Rocket League) and occasionally cook/bake.
